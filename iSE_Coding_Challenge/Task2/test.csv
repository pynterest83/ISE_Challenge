This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform
the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed
fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the
previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the 
dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed 
legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that
the odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has
to report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer,
and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that
the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo 
was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must 
be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage 
of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is 
affixed to the door frame of the vehicle. 

Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search
(which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.

Call your state's Department of Transportation/Public Safety/Motor
Vehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what your
rights are. Your state's Attorney General will know for certain ;-)

You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop!  What if you are on an
Xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine?  That is when the
load problems occur.  If you had a machine with 20 Xterminals attached and
they all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste.

I'm not picking on you, just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life
out there besides distributed or singleuser ""Workstations""!"

'Alone'? Sorry, but the following western scholars are forced to disagree 
with you. During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, 
tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against 
the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and 
deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

5,5,"Will someone who can 'see' the X-Face included in this header please reply
and tell me if it turned out okay?

I'm not all too sure about my viewing software.  I *hand*-converted this
thing in ""vi"" from a Sun rasterfile... what a pain!

For folks who haven't the slightest, it went like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------

		How to Make Your Own X-Face:
		   in 0x000F Easy Steps!

	1. Scan my Drivers' License into a *.PCX file.
	2. Use WinGIF to 'trim' my face out of the license,
		'reduce' it by half, and
		convert it to *.BMP.
	3. Use Paintbrush to touch up manually.
	4. Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half again.
	5. Use Paintbrush to touch up again.
	6. Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half *again*
		and convert it to *.GIF.

		[now over to the UNIX side...]

	7. Use Snapshot to convert the *.GIF to a Sun rasterfile.
	8. Use IconEdit to touch it up and
		convert it to an X bitmap.
	9. Use ""vi"" (yes, a *text* editor) to manually convert
		the rasterfile into the ""Uncompressed X-Face"" format.
		(Lots of global ""ed"" commands, and by the time you're
		 done you'll mirror hex bytewise in your sleep!!)

		[now over to the *Linux* side...]

	A. Use ""compface"" to convert it to what you see here:

 %:A<m@Dob}BO""'E"",EEQGbn7qy(En7aS5U([k//""G{6^HIbY9X8~+PD($}6szF""&vVxCXSn
 8mw^0G#nVHE%W,`X""[j0s{r.~%zs:O|HFU=LwzYgH

	B. Try viewing it by whatever means you have available.
	C. Go back to step 9, but do it *right* this time."

That depends on how this verse is read.  There are at least two
meanings of the word ""once"".  1) only one time, and 2) at some
other time (i.e. once upon a time).  Note that in the previous
verse, the word ""once"" is used with the second meaning, and also
in the following verse, ""once"" is again used with the second meaning.
The Greek, I am sure, uses different words for each of the two meanings
for the English word ""once"".  I am not a Greek scholar, but I'm sure
someone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning.
If the second meaning is being used, that verse can be interpreted as:

  - for it was once given for men to die (beginning with Adam), but 
    after this [gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ] the judgement
    [is made available], for now there is no longer death, but life
    with Christ."

Actually, a WERA racer, William Lumsden, considered running a Vmax in 
A Superstock.  He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day, and
_really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a 
sideways Vmax in the corners, and if they passed him going in, he'd
blow by down the straight (usually wobbling).  Needless to say, since
he was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 CB400F, he decided against the Vmax.

Thanks for posting that.  I was surprised to notice, however, that one
question I might have expected to be asked was not:  ""Are all forms of
strong encryption other than the Clipper to be made illegal?""  Speaking
of which, is anyone aware of whether that question *has* been asked of
any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government?  I have
not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been

account of the events would nmot be the most respected. Case
and point, the resurrection. By claiming that the resurrection
actually happened the early preachers were able to convert many

case for the resurrected saints who walked around Jerusalem and
appeared to ""many People"" you would realize that other
historians (Josephus for one) would have reported on it all if
it happened. The fact that the Bible speaks of events of such
great magnitude that they would have been noticed taken with
the fact that they are not reported on by historians could only
mean that the bible contains many made up stories.

semi-automatic rifles? It seems even he didn't trust in himself.

28,28,"I have the Logitech hand scanner for the Mac.  It uses a SCSI
interface box that the standard scanner unit plugs into.  I
have tried my friend's IBM hand scanner with the scsi box and
it works.  See if you can get Logitech to sell you the scsi
box by itself.  Warning:  most of the cost of Mac handscanners
is contained in the scsi interface box, so it could run up
to around $200.  When I upgraded my old style scanner to
the new gray scale model, it cost $75; they just gave me a new
scan head and software; the box was the same.  The gray scale
scanner + interface runs about $300; making it around $200 for
the interface."

Which bus???

I think there are several reasons :-

50MHz motherboards are harder to get right
50MHz need a fast L2 cache - 12-15ns is a good idea
50MHz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant VESA bus
66MHz DX2 chips are faster for a lot of things


With a good, fast L2 cache a DX2/66 is going be be faster than a DX50...

What do I have?

A DX50 of course!

Presumably the B-D did not mount a continuous state of alert with gunmen
ready to fire on people who casually walked up to ring the doorbell.

Once inside the building the BATF would have been in control. Trained
police officers are a match to any bunch of Bozos playing at soldiers.



Not a smart move. Unless meant to be part of the surprize cover. Even so
the narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good idea. A side opening
truck would have been much better, more like a covered waggon.



Sounds just about right to me. Its the minimum amount of force that I
would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talk.politics.guns
annual dinner.

Michael Hesseltine ordered the use of over 5000 crack troops including
members of the parachute regiment to remove approx 250 hippy peace
protestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise missiles. He
even turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the proceedings. Just about the
most dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin opener. That single
action probably cost him the position as Prime Minister. One of the elders
of my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of Toryism.
Hesseltine ever after was something of a national joke.

This is a heavily edited/modified version of the Gopher FAQ intended to
give people just starting with gopher enough information to get a
client and jump into Gopher-space - a complete version can be obtained
as described below.  Once you have a gopher client point it at 
merlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher-space!

Common Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher, a
client/server protocol for making a world wide information service,
with many implementations.  Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher, 
comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks.

The most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, or
via anonymous ftp:

rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq

Those without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body to find out
how to do FTP by e-mail.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
List of questions in the Gopher FAQ:

Q0:  What is Gopher?
Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?
Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?
Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher?
Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?
Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?
Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?
Q7: What is veronica?
Q8: What is Available for Biology?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q0:  What is Gopher?

A0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed
     information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide
     information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While
     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher
     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers
     throughout the world. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?

A1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory
     /pub/gopher

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?

A2:  You will need a gopher ""client"" program that runs on your local PC
     or workstation

     There are clients for the following systems.  The directory
     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous
     ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory
     /pub/gopher.

      Unix Curses & Emacs   :  /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12.tar.Z
      Xwindows (athena)     :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xgopher1.2.tar.Z
      Xwindows (Motif)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/moog
      Xwindows (Xview)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xvgopher
      Macintosh Hypercard   :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher/old-versions *
      Macintosh Application :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher *
      DOS w/Clarkson Driver :  /pub/gopher/PC_client/
      NeXTstep              :  /pub/gopher/NeXT/
      VM/CMS                :  /pub/gopher/Rice_CMS/ or /pub/gopher/VieGOPHER/
      VMS                   :  /pub/gopher/VMS/
      OS/2 2.0	            :  /pub/gopher/os2/
      MVS/XA                :  /pub/gopher/mvs/

     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the
     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.  

      A Microsoft Windows Winsock client ""The Gopher Book""
        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip

      A Macintosh Application, ""MacGopher"".
        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *

      Another Macintosh application, ""GopherApp"".
        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *

      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP
        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe

      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS
     	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe

      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace
      for DOS
         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher

      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX
         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE


     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.

     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client
     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:

       Type=1
       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu
       Port=70
       Path=
       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.

 
     Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and
     look in the gopher directory.


     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.
     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine
     ""consultant.micro.umn.edu"" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more
     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client
     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A
     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,
     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to
     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?

A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize
     network lag.

     Telnet Public Logins:

     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area
     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------
     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America
     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America
     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America
     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe
     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia
     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden
     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America
     ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador
     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan


     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of
     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the
     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)
     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features
     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file
     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp
     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?

A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University
     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help
     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  

     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information
     System used by a large number of sites in the world.

     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to
     count. 

     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:
   
      Internet Gopher Developers
      100 Union St. SE #190
      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA

     Or via FAX at:
 
      +1 (612) 625-6817

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?

A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.
     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: 
     
       - Search local WAIS indices.
       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using
         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?

A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :

Q7: What is veronica?

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to 
     Computerized Archives.

     veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles
     in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica 
     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher
     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.
     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy
     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the
     gopher protocol.

     To try veronica, select it from the ""Other Gophers"" menu on 
     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:

     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) 
     Type=1 
     Port=70 
     Path=1/veronica 
     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, a person could have great respect for Jesus and yet be an

Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By 
the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas, 
the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round
trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as
5000 kg in a Low Earth ""advertising"" orbit: Very roughly the
same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were
to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...

The night sky on a Lunar backpacking trip would still be very 
pristine... 

There's always been a problem of having to get 
away from civilization before you can really find ""natural""
scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip
of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles
or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards
on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still
""wild."" While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital
billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of 
growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will
not save your view of the night sky, because by the time 
such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble
finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_
the stars...

 
An ad on a moon of Jupiter would be rather pointless, since you need
a telescope to see them. However, I'd love to see them get all
the publicity they could from underwritting the ""Coca Cola Io
Orbital Mapping Probe.""  


They already can, to some extent: The IAU allows names derived from
sponsors or patrons of scientific research. If Microscum donates
money to a university astronomy program, one of the galactic 
astronomers could easily get a newly discovered galaxy named after
them."

two months ago. I don't rember the detail. What I'd like to have is one 
software to organize the literature I'm refereing for scientific

a. able to do data-base managment
b. able to print with special formats for different journals
Any info would be appreciated.

 > being scorched for his wrongdoings....

Stephen, I suspect that when you and I use the word ""Hell,"" we have
different concepts in mind. When you encounter references to Heaven
in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do
not suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden
streets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the
concept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that
about the ""fires"" of Hell?
     Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the
last description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the
Ferris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant
by Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this
connection, there are two reasons that occur to me.
     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as
something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as
any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart --
but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS
SHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with
matches).
     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word ""Gehenna,""
one of the words translated ""Hell"" in the New Testament. It refers
to the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a
place where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)
to Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires
burned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem.
""To be cast into Gehenna"" or ""to burn in Gehenna"" thus became a
metaphor for ""to be rejected or discarded as worthless.""

Lest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart
is my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT
DIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no
flames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most
bookstores and libraries."
39,39,"I have a question for y'all:

I'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5"" FAST SCSI-2 drives from Micropolis
in the June, 1993, MacWorld. (I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions
in IBM PC magazines)

Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface,
but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,
*max*.

How can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 it
had to have a DTR of 10megs a second?

(I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache.
I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data
at 5megs a second!)"

 Pink Noise and White Noise are equal amounts of all frequencies.  This
is in most cases around the 20-3.3K Hz range.  Pink/White are used to

I don't think mr. Clinton can even understand the technical details of

Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.
It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may
share experience on that.)

Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal
cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
So my advice is the 66/VLB.




Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have
paging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is
cached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more
memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).


The bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from
0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the
same results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed
(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is
lousy.


The rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come
out. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only
sell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB.

This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi
perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every
time there is a game-winning hit.  The ""clutch pitching"" quoted above is
something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should
be expected to be a clutch pitcher.



Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch
hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points,
standard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league,
just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.

And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between
clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,
probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather
than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to
pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past.

But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.
Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of
Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  Do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?  Do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?

AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem

The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer
than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,
v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so
you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone
line.  They will ""fall back"" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even
disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to
connect with slower and older modems.

It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with
multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).

They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)
which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and
cleanest connection possible.

These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech
support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.

They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the
NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which
will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows
application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of
any font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax
graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,
as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).

I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or
below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an
equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is
backed by a company that will never go away.

This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of
downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home
to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal
modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including
installation.)

If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem
at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for
about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.

If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at 
(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.

To put it bluntly, they are full of it.

Paying a tape is playing a tape.  There is no difference whether the 
output goes to a second VCR or to a TV.  (How the VCR or TV reacts to 
this signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision 
copy protection.)

In order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry 
of its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow 
magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The 
circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.

It is a pretty lame scare tactic.  (I've seen something similar on a BBS.

Well, if our observer X is as likely to be in A's position as B's, and if he
agrees that both A and B are making appropriate observations and inferences
regarding the situation, then I would expect him to conclude that there is no
right answer.  Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow
him to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.

If, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I
suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.

It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from
all perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any
conclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my
perspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to
life; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what
they like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in
favour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise
solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and
deciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This
is also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own
decisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy
with current UK abortion law.

Similarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and
I really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't even
know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.

DSS-65 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer
Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29)
at approximately 6:00 AM.  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34
meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into
Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers
reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes
were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and
AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These
readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM
yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check
failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be
determining the precise cause over the next few days.

As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial
Reference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to
command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today."

75,75,"It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of
nightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  
   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three
games of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a
best of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this
time.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.
   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice
advantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It
wasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.
   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting
goaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.
Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on
the powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.
LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was
Khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres
stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and
Hannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a
shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob
Sweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of
penalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get
his first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes
later, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied
the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.
Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet
revenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a
tip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.
Both teams finished with 34 shots.  
        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.
        Referee--Rob Shick.

Comments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of
clutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic
again.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead
flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea
to Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever
heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was
only five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no
one took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,
noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was
too loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as
most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev
didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't
skate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each
were out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in
an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he
responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than
that, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The
interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he
must not understand playoffs.  Uh-huh.

Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes
showing
the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so
newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there
would
appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how
dramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the
situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued
throughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central
spotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman's
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it's
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,
some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued
to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these

groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of 
hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard 
was annoying.)

Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at
""organized""
Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam
which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a ""secular"" Islam - an Islam
separated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and most
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie
made
his views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. The
scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this
time,
already a political situation - affecting governments as well as
individuals.
The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.
At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -
engaged
in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.

Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as

this has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any
kind, has no
obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till
matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in ""boldly""
defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary
work, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as
a kind of secular ""heroic Knight"",mounted on the his media steed,
 doing battle with the ""dragon"" of Islamic ""fundamentalism"".

Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who 
grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear, 
who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions
to slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -
who, when
faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with
his mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were
injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,
continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.
Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief
making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths
of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief
even after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to
decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the
centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the
continuing mischief - all media support, government support was
just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who
were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy
to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that
deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief
making, was applied to Rushdie.


I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. ""Image"" is
the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie.
If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture
within a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws
had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam
would then be thought to have a good ""image"" (Principally because it would
by and large reflect the secular image). A ""good image"" usually means "" be
more
like me"".

Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude
that
resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.

84,84,"After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HD
Slash cut pipes I installed my new Bubs (which I had been planning to
do anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with no
problem at about 97 dB.

Two points:

First, I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. 
Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and
doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced
the dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, make
sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from
the body.

Second, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific. At low revs or cruising
through town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats
a more throaty, purring, rumble.  When you open her up to >3000 RPM
they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. Best of both worlds!"

of doing so.  The US, the ""place of refuge"" allowed in a bare pittance

While we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verified
against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon,
regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.  There is
no proof that the chip won't squeel and role over for someone with the
proper knowledge to interrogate it via the communications link.

The design examination should be done to the gate level.  Also, how does one
verify that what you are looking at is reflected in tapeout, or masks?

The silicon should be examined as well, the design in hand (a clean room
publicly defined clipper chip) can be merged with another design later, or
changed between completion and mask out.  There is little proof that what
you are told is in the chip is all that is in the chip.

Put the (verified) masks in escrow, and use them for chip production,

That has not been demonstrated.  Had he come to trial, there was a very real
possibility that Koresh would have gotten an acquittal on grounds of self-
defense.  All survivors of the debacle have sworn that the BATF shot first.


They ""rang the doorbell"" using a concussion grenade!  And if the bloody
warrants were ""legal"" then why were they _sealed_ after the fight started?
And if Koresh had declared himself a ""private state"" and was just daring the
gov't to go in, then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who
served a warrant _for_his_arrest_ (as opposed to the BATF search warrant,
which did not include arrest unless violations were found) by just calling
him up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car?
That doesn't sound like a dictator to me, it sounds like someone who knows
he has a court battle.  Things might have gone very differently if the BATF
_had_ ""rung the doorbell"".


This is stupid.  That is no paranoid assertion, it is testamony from surviving
witnesses, and the BATF _has_ no tanks, nor am I aware of either the BATF _or_
the FBI using any until yesterday.  When they use maximum force they do just
what they did that first day that got four officers killed.


""Underarmed""?  You flabberghast me, they were loaded for bear and every
picture shows them wearing bullet-proof vests!  They were using concussion
grenades and full-auto weapons, what was missing low-yield tac-nukes?  This
is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount
of force used, both initially and yesterday.  You should be ashamed.


They _had_ a sure-fire method: keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looney-tune religious
stunt.

Phil, I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you

with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust, a process
that is in place _now_ in this country, even if the tattered, pitiful remains
of the Constitution is slowing its progress.  This isn't a Libertarian issue,
others may argue that line, but from a strictly Constitutional view of a
democratic gov't, what the FBI and BATF did was wrong, wrong, wrong, even if
their _reasons_ for trying to arrest Koresh were 100% right.  _Anything_ that
leads to the deaths of 17 children, if nothing else touches your stoney
heart, is _wrong_ no matter who pushed the button.  For God's sake, man, get

The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this
passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  Jesus' words
seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their
question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection.
This being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my
opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those
who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  Other-
wise, why would Jesus offer ""but are like the angels in heaven"" as a
contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in
marriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall,
and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  Or at least,
that's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of 
marriages performed on earth.  Your mileage may vary. :)"

There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of
fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles
exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching
arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise
also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally
distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to ""spot reduce"" body fat
other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is
genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like ""fat"",
so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the ""fat""
is ""changing"" into ""muscle"", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally
separate, and one does not ever ""change into"" the other.

Please cite specific examples where an Arab party member was rejected
while a Jewish party member was accepted.  If you examine these I am
sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power
base that his Jewish counterpart had.  The party structure in Israel
has changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go.  Knesset
members for most parties are now elected via primaries.  The top standing
members end up with cabinet posts.  This is purely a political power
issue.  Check the ranking of Arab labor party members, as opposed
to Jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by Jews that
ranked lower in the party than their Arab fellow electees.

Once again, if for arguments sake, all the Arab Israelis were to vote
for Labor at the next election, you can rest assured that the number of
Arab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the
power shift.


You are overlooking the fact that they wield political power
as individuals based upon a wider collective power base.

goes I think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing Jews

I had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year.  She said
that when she and my father were raising we four children, they
did not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised
in their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be
alienated from them and it would create problems.
  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They
raised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable
demands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.
  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and
never absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God
never involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that
I may someday be held responsible for the things that offended
Him...sins that the ""world"" told me were OK.
  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised
four extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more
complete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice
and punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many
grave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married
and divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for
change...but I shouldn't have married to person in the first place )
and more....
  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing
us to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by
accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or
counsel.
  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they
*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls
because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and
difficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able
to say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and
compassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not
want to hear and will stay away from you.
  This life is ""but dust"". As long as the comfort of this life
is our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those
with whom we come in contact.
  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who
support the ""right"" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,
or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in
this time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving
friend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that
what I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me
living the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent
people. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)
It is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer
life to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.
Think about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that
a friend is in error, but you don't want to ""cause trouble"".
Righteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we are
we are Christ's lips and hands on earth. Don't be afraid to
simply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say a
fervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance.
In more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother's
keeper."

123,123,"While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it must
be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis   
Joseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.
Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there 
would probably be a game 6 scheduled.  

As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.
One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to
give them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck
hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot
for Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis'
goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone
who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.
Finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot.

I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to see
Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph
won't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack.

Just for the record, read your owner's manual before attempting a push start.
Most manufacturers today do not recommend this (I think the catalytic converter
is the primary reason - unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when
the converter gets into its operating range).

The best reason for a manual? Because you like to drive one. I find that its
much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car. Remember, pay 
attention out there - stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people

Hmmm.  You need to spend some time in a library, son.

When the Bill of Rights was written, in addition to the (muzzleloading)
shotgun and pistol you mention we had:

 - rifles in calibers ranging from around .30 to .69 caliber and up.
 - cannon with various different projectiles to choose from (and owned
   by civilians).
 - breech-loading rifles

In addition, semiautomatic and full-automatic firearms had been patented
and/or demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding
century or so.


Sounds good.  Any refererences to this actually happening, or is it
just exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone
firing a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an
Uzi, semi- or full-auto?


Until the root conditions that justified it go away (criminal behavior,
either private or government, which should be defended against), there's
no reason it should go away.

Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you 
have to feel guilty, and then there's this single personality
that will save you from this universal guilt feeling.

Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,
I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this
huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.

If things happen wrong, I will try to learn from the mistakes
and go on.

This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain
personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain
religious doctrines. And if your personality type is 
opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain
world view system.


All I know is that I don't know everything. And frankly speaking
I don't care, life is fun anyway. I recognize that I'm not 
perfect, but that does not hinder me from have a healthy
and inspiring life.

There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice
thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,
the shoulders feel far more relaxed!

Government troops 'steal women, children'


WASHINGTON - Government troops in Sudan are involved in massacres,
kidnapping and the transporting of forced labor into Libya, according
to a State Department document declassified Wednesday.

    The report compiled by the U.S. embassy in Khartoum said government
forces, particularly Arab militias organized as the Popular Defense
Forces, ""routinely steal women and children"" in southern Sudan."

[stuff about hardware keys]


True, which is why many of the newer keys ship out, oh, maybe 32 bits or
so, have the key encrypt them, and return them to the PC.  Making a bunch
of these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure
things won't run without the key. :-)  Anyway, then, this scheme at least
defeats your approach.  It's a little costly, though.

Personally, I don't believe in copy protection, and agree with the thought
that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs
the gains from what few pirates won't be able to copy the program."

                         OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS
                         FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY

     Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai (""homosexuals"") in 1 Cor 6:9
and 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex,
specifically homosexualitiy.  Some restrict the term's meaning to ""active male
prostititute,"" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,
namely ""homosexuals.""  More recently the definition ""homosexual"" has been
opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term
""homosexuals"" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional
rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. 
A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only
factor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of
arsenokoitai by ""homosexuals"" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. 
Finally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it
from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation
and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline
(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).

                                   INTRODUCTION

     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has
been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or
sodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used
twice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous
scrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since
so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, 
the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church
and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.

     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and
evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence
to point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the
modern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have
provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider
acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the
ministry.

   You're blowing smoke.  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas
   markets like Japan and the EC.  The government told them ""don't do encryption
   if you ever hope to export this technology"".  The reason that CDMA doesn't
   have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door.
   It's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular
   is big enough for them.  This is just the International Traffic in Arms
   Regulations all over again.

Perry has already stated on the net that Qualcomm wanted to sell overseas, and
the government told them they wouldn't be allowed to export,
so he's only blowing the same smoke you are :-)
Sure, they probably could have made a US version, and a non-crypto
export version, and contracted with a Bulgarian or Japanese software house to
develop an overseas crypto ROM, but that's getting pretty expensive.

   No, Cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different
   stuff for domestic use vs. export.  Qualcomm isn't.  So Cylink makes
   money--that's capitalism, comrade.

Well, some people like capitalism, and others prefer free enterprise;
they're different!  Using the government to stifle your competition is capitalist.

   you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it?

Writing good crypto code is something most good programmers can do;
writing good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill.
Developing new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized,
but finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you don't
have enough horsepower is still fairly hairy stuff.
Once the 586/Pentium becomes widespread, or the next generation of
sound boards has DSPs on it, I suspect we'll see it happen.

of his erroneous claim, and at most explode them.

Basic fact #1, Mr. Sternlight:  The RIGHT described is a ""right of the people

     I have recently used the 4066 to switch a bipolar signal.  I simply
ran the 4066 off a bipolar supply, +/- 8V in this case.   As long as your
analog input signal stays between the supply rails, the 4066 will work fine.
Of course, your control (logic) input must use -8V as the logic LOW and
+8V as the logic HIGH reference, so that either (1) all your driving logic
must be 4000 CMOS with the same bipolar supply or (2) you must provide
some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the 4066 and the
control logic.  In my case, I was able to use the bipolar supply all the
way.

3) If the distribution is smooth,  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLY

we are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud,  but then it needs

4)  we know it's not real close,  like  slightly extra solar,  because
we have no parallax measurements on the bursts.

5)  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or
super string  impacts or something like that.

Thank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being
a Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a
conviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the ""fundy"" part as the
term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to
those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and
wish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it
matter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been
satisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling
struggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.

With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you
to re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume
that defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his
right to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'
theology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-
Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect
of the tragic events of the past few days.

Nor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the
federal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting
infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not
fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are
state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the
local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having
ever been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent
as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least
that's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-
gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a
lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might
bring upon him.  

But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the
building in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined
by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse
and none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with
Davidians several times before the conflagration, reported that
the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.

Ultimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh
is quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a
most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.
So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One
who has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left
on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong
message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the
people it serves.

to fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which

Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for
several weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to
be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I
found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about
to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of
another programmable system called ReSound.

Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for
about 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex.
Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was
impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I
will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one
patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound

The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the
Widex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the
difference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I am

                         THE LIES OF TEXAS

Okay, what have we learned?

For reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known 
-- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative 
committees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard
of the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and 
personal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the 
First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to 
the Constitution. 

The man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw 
agency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own 
losses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his 
electricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside 
world. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in 
pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency 
finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit 
eager to gain credit for ""straightening out the mess"" -- and, more 
importantly, to script his side of the subsequent ""negotiations"" 
any way they please. 

The impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time 
four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a 
single individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. 
Armored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers 
using scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious 
records at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive 
those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority 
will mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean 
Communists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). 

Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising 
of the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house 
and gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and 
is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, 
including those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. 

Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the 
President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: 
blame the victim. 

He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a 
secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being 
""examined"" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children 
-- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. 
He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in 
3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that 
Jim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to 
embarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was 
severed at the start of the whole travesty. 

A leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe 
that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow 
responsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever 
know 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound 
more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? 

Very well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never 
forget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and 
rightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, 
it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which 
may explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage 
and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) 
about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a 
mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. 

More importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower 
of Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance 
as Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the 
system, then at least within yourself. 

On March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of 
the Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw 
agency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised 
in its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both 
agencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped 
to write that plank. 

True, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in 
1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone 
in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their 
behinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what 
happened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, 
Waco never would have happened. 

Think about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough 
of political parties more interested in collecting and holding 
power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human 
life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe 
the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less 
tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.

Think about it.

7404 inverter if labor costs almost nothing."

    Hi,
      I've been using Plannet Crafter's ""Plug-in"" for Program Manager.
      Its listed in most BBS'es as PLUGIN13.  Its an add-on which gives
      some needed features to Progman; such as the ability to better
      manage your groups, change your cursor and icons on the fly,
      constant status of RAM and resources, ""Quick-menu"" (a drop-down
      menu of DOS commands or app launcher), plus some other neat stuff.
      Used it, liked it, and even reg'd it <G>.

      If you can't find it anywhere, let me know and I'll zip it up and
      mail it to you (shareware version, of course <g>...)

Aloha...

Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer,
I'll supply one.

Yes, even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering.  Basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left.  It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle
than a bicycle though, because of the extra weight.  (Ok, so my
motorcycle is heavy.  Maybe yous isn't.)"

I don't know what you mean by 'edged', but surely there are two other
possibilities for an isotropic distribution: near interstellar (up to
~100 pc, i.e. within the disc), or the Galaxy's corona?

I don't have the faintest idea what literature it is to which you 
refer. Is this an explicit statement by some document? Or is it your 
interpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment 
of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In 
any case, a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts:


Source: Walker, Christopher: ""Armenia: The Survival of a Nation.""
        New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980.

This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information
of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: 

a) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the 
architect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected 
of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic 
in Berlin during World War II; 

b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social 
theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members 
of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' 

c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves 
with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, 

d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side 
by side with the Wehrmacht.

 
In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast 
network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. 
Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in 
Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and 
fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. 
They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in 
an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of 
this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, 
1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians 
were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed 
pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.


In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi
concentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first
Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion 
had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro 
(the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the 
architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds 
between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious 
Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged 
by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of 
extermination of the Jews.

This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and
exterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.

Anton LaVey's interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me.  I
read his ""Satanic Bible"" a few years ago for a social studies project,
as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called ""The Cult of Devil Worship
in America.""  The latter included a very interesting interview with
the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an
instrument for one to realize the self.  

When I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic
ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I
don't consider LaVey's church to be at all ""orthodox,"" nor do I consider
its followers ""satanists.""  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche,
Crowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little
touch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan.
No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I
suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.

At any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a
huge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr.
and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the 
way.)  

I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as
a Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of
Satan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Webster's Dictionary
and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same."

Basically the right question, although I was interested in cases closer
to home where the Sun is behind either a natural object or effective
shielding.


Good point (and thanks for the references)."

I recently watched a an episode of ""The Old West"" a TV show on the 
Discovery Channel (or perhaps the A&E Network), the one hosted by Kenny
Rogers.  This episode was all about the Mormons and how they settled Utah,
etc.

A large portion of the broadcast was about the ""Mountain Meadows Massacre"".
The program very specifically pointed out that Brigham Young knew nothing
about the incident until long after it had happened (before telegraph), and
it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid Moromn
settlers into what amounted to a mob.  All participants in the incident were
prosecuted and eccomunicated from the LDS Church.

I suggest you watch a rerun of that episode (they play them over and over) 
and see what they (non-Mormons) have to say about it.

	Be aware, this is a very high-end card, capable of 4MB of VRAM,
	so it does not come CHEAP. But, I have personally seen TWO of
	these boards running a dual screen Windows 3.1.

I once wrote such a program (in BBC basic...) It was very crude, and took
around 5 seconds to do an exhaustive search (with a small amount of 
intelligence), and told you the best combination >Rq and the best below Rq.

If you want to write one, just store the prefered values in an array, and
then search the solution space using three nested loops. I'm sure you
could knock this up in an hour.
